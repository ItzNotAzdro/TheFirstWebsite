                I really enjoy Music, both listening and producing my own.</p>
            <p>My first introduction into coding was with Arduino, as i wanted to make
                an alarm that wouldnt turn off until i turned my pc on.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've been amazed by the amount of things that were possible
                just from putting a few things together and deloping some code for it.</p>
